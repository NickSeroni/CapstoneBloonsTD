# Nick Seroni Senior Capstone

This is the senior capstone project for Nick Seroni's computer science career at Carthage College.
It is a clone of Bloons TD by Ninja Kiwi.


## Motivation

After dabbling with the Godot Engine for a few years, I thought my capstone project
would be a good opportunity to deeply learn the engine by finishing a full game. 
I felt that an established game design that I already like would help me focus on
the actual programming, so I chose to clone Bloons TD. I think the tower defense genre
strikes a good balance between fun to play and challenge to develop.
